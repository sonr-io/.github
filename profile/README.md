Sonr is building the most immersive DWeb experience for both Users and Developers alike. We believe the best way to onboard the next billion users is to create a cohesive end-to-end platform that’s composable and interoperable with all existing protocols.

For this we built our Networking layer in Libp2p and our Layer 1 Blockchain with Starport. Our network comprises of two separate nodes: Highway and Motor, which each have a specific use case on the network. In order to maximize the onboarding experience, we developed our own embeddable node named "Motor", which has native functionality for discovery, exchange, transmission, and wallet interactions.
